any code

== Description ==

This is a wordpress plugin for highlight.js library.
Highlight.js highlights syntax in code examples on any web pages. 
It's very easy to use because it works automatically: finds
blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it.

This plugin allow you load highlight.js from local storage or from CDN.
If you use local highlight.js, you can also choose only partly languages  
to make javascript file smaller(the smallest size is about 31KB).

On the other hand.This plugin allow you to switch syntax highlighter from
other libraries. For now, we support SyntaxHighlighter and Prettify. 

= Features: =
